NULL VALUE

/* Data type 'null' is not '0' it's not undefined
it's not an empty string it simply means
that you have a variable where an object reference
was expected but it's not set to any object reference
it's different than undefined. because says i'm expecting
to have a value but one was never set and it was object reference.
